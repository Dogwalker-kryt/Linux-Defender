# Linux-Defender

**I wanted to make a Anti malware programm for Linux **
- i'm programing it on Linx Mint, so it will be only working on Debian based Linux
- i hope it will work

**Advise**
- this is just a projekt and not an alternative to other Anti Malware programms

**last chages**
- added color to text ([ok] and [threat])
- added hashes to the sigantures list for better detection
- i dont know what i added more (i added so much)




**work in progress**
